This Java console application is a simple student record manager utilizing a hash table data structure for efficient data management.  It allows users to add new student records (ID and name), search for students by ID, delete student records, and exit the program.  The hash table implementation, employing a modulo hash function and separate chaining to handle collisions, provides average O(1) time complexity for these operations. This project was developed to solidify my understanding of hash table implementation and its practical application in data management; while a basic example, it demonstrates fundamental principles applicable to more complex student information systems or other applications requiring efficient data retrieval.
